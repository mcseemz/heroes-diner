# Heroes bar, Worchester

### PoC for mobile game

The game itself is a mix of Mafia and Wordle.<br>
This is a prototype, so it's in the text mode.<br>
There are bugs and missing parts (e.g. heroes gender pronouns are always "he".)<br>
And player has to enter commands with keyboard.<br>
Ideal terminal height should be 42+ lines<br>

The task of the game is to pass the toughest location, Dracula's Castle.<br>
For that you should have properly assembled team of 5, with 4 different adventurers skills, and one leader.<br>
The leader is a special skill that rarely participates, but can empower others, or make a note of their behaviour.<br>

By visiting different locations you will get a report about team behaviour, skills and teamwork.<br>
Some information mapped to heroes and location automatically, other you should deduct.<br>
You may use team management commands to mark skills you suggest for team members.<br>

Each location consists of several trials, and optional teamwork event.<br>
Trials are mandatory, while winning teamwork will give you bonuses.<br>
Although there are also trials requiring enough teamwork to pass.<br>

Passing trial will make heroes more powerful.<br>
You can also use powerups from bonuses to assign more powers to a hero.<br>
Powered Leader can identify bad actors.<br>

The report you get at the end of visiting location, it might contain multiple events.<br>
Read it carefully, and check for the hints.<br>
You have limited number of turns to find your ideal team.<br>

In your team there are 10 heroes. 2 per each skill.<br>
One hero per skill always has teamwork of +1, other have 0, and couple even -1.<br>
Total teamwork you can see after passing a location, unrelated to bonus.<br>

The screen has 4 panels. Top left is the list of locations.<br>
Top right is your roster with marked team members.<br>
Bottom left is the latest report. And bottom right is the current stats.<br>

Check help command for a list of available commands.<br>
You may kick a person out if you found he's useless or bad actor.<br>
And you have a single save slot to save you game in your working folder.<br>

The game difficulty set to easy, there are more locations than required. Generally, player has 3 more moves than required.<br> 
Locations and trials are predefined, Heroes are generated. 

Good luck.
